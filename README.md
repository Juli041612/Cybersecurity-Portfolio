# 👋 About Me

My name is Julian, and I am passionate about protecting people and organizations from digital threats.  
I enjoy analyzing systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and finding practical solutions.  
I value integrity, responsibility, and continuous learning.  

I’m currently completing the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and building my first cybersecurity projects,  
including risk assessments, compliance checklists, and network analysis reports.  
My goal is to start my career as a **Security Analyst** and keep improving every day.

# 🧰 Projects

### 🔹 Risk Assessment
- **Project:** Botium Toys – Security Risk Assessment  
- **Description:** Evaluated assets, risk levels, and compliance based on NIST CSF framework.  
- **Skills:** Risk analysis, reporting, compliance review.  
- **File:** [Botium_Toys_Risk_Assessment.pdf](./Botium-Toys-Scope-goals-and-risk-assessment-report.pdf)

### 🔹 Compliance Checklist
- **Project:** Botium Toys – Controls & Compliance Checklist  
- **Description:** Reviewed internal controls and compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC2.  
- **File:** [Controls_Compliance_Checklist.pdf](./Controls-and-compliance-checklist.pdf)

  ### 🔹 Incident Report (NIST CSF)
- **Project:** Cybersecurity analyst working for a multimedia company  
- **Description:**The organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network. The company’s cybersecurity team then investigated the security event , fix it and need a report using National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)
- **Skills:** Risk analysis, reporting, compliance review.  
- **File:** [Incident-report-analysis.pdf](./Incident-report-analysis.pdf)

### 🔹 File Permissions in Linux
- **Project:** Linux File Permissions Management  
- **Description:** Analyzed and modified file and directory permissions in a Linux environment to ensure proper user and group access. Used core Linux commands to inspect existing permissions and adjust them according to security requirements, reinforcing the principle of least privilege.  
- **Skills:** Linux permissions, access control, chmod, ls -la, user/group management, security fundamentals.  
- **File:** [File permissions in Linux .pdf](./File-permissions-in-Linux.pdf)

### 🔹 Vulnerability Assessment Report
- **Project:** Server Vulnerability & Risk Assessment  
- **Description:** Conducted a vulnerability and risk assessment on a Linux-based server hosting a MySQL database containing sensitive customer and analytics data. Evaluated access controls and exposure risks using the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 framework. Identified threat sources, assessed likelihood and impact, calculated risk levels, and proposed remediation strategies to protect sensitive information and ensure database privacy.  
- **Skills:** Vulnerability assessment, risk analysis, NIST SP 800-30, access control evaluation, threat modeling, security reporting, principle of least privilege, MFA.  
- **File:** [Vulnerability_Assessment_Report.pdf](./Vulnerability-assessment-report-template.pdf)

### 🔹 Incident Handler’s Journal
- **Project:** Cybersecurity Incident Handling Journal  
- **Description:** Documented and analyzed multiple simulated cybersecurity incidents following an incident handler’s journal format. Each entry captured the 5 W’s (Who, What, When, Where, Why) for incidents involving phishing, ransomware, malware delivery via email attachments, and large-scale data breaches. The project emphasizes incident analysis, root cause identification, and security awareness from a SOC analyst perspective.  
- **Skills:** Incident response fundamentals, incident documentation, phishing analysis, ransomware awareness, malware analysis, VirusTotal, security awareness, critical thinking.  
- **File:** [Incident_Handlers_Journal.pdf](./Incident-handler-s-journal-.pdf)

### 🔹 Algorithm for File Updates in Python
- **Project:** Access Control Automation with Python  
- **Description:** Developed a Python-based algorithm to maintain an IP allow list for restricted network access in a healthcare environment. The script reads authorized IP addresses from a file, compares them against a removal list, removes unauthorized entries, and updates the original file. This project demonstrates automation of access control tasks while reinforcing the principle of least privilege.  
- **Skills:** Python, file handling, access control automation, loops and conditionals, list manipulation, cybersecurity fundamentals, principle of least privilege.  
- **File:** [Python_Access_Control_Algorithm.pdf](./Algorithm-for-file-updates-in-Python.pdf)
