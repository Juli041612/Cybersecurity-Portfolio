# 👋 About Me

My name is Julian, and I am passionate about protecting people and organizations from digital threats.  
I enjoy analyzing systems, identifying vulnerabilities, and finding practical solutions.  
I value integrity, responsibility, and continuous learning.  

I’m currently completing the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and building my first cybersecurity projects,  
including risk assessments, compliance checklists, and network analysis reports.  
My goal is to start my career as a **Security Analyst** and keep improving every day.
